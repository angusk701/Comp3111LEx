# Java Power and Factorial Calculation Project

This project demonstrates the use of recursion to compute the power of a number and the factorial of a number using Java. The program consists of two main classes:

1. **`mainApp1.java`** - The main application that runs the code.
2. **`myLibrary.java`** - A utility class that contains the `Power` and `factorial` methods.

## Project Structure

- `mainApp1.java`
- `myLibrary.java`
